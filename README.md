# üîê Create a Strong Passwords and Evaluate Its Strength

## Overview
This task involved creating passwords with varying complexity, testing them using an online password strength checker, and documenting best practices for secure password creation.

## Steps Performed
1. Created multiple passwords of different complexity levels.
2. Tested each password at [Password Meter](https://passwordmeter.com).
3. Recorded scores and feedback.
4. Summarized best practices for password creation.
5. Researched common password attacks and their prevention.

## Passwords Tested and Results
| Password                 | Score | Feedback Summary |
|--------------------------|-------|------------------|
| `password`               | 5%    | Too short, common word, no numbers/symbols |
| `Password123`            | 42%   | Contains common word, predictable pattern |
| `P@ssword123!`           | 74%   | Good mix of characters, still contains dictionary word |
| `Z#7gLp2!rQ8wB`          | 96%   | Excellent randomness, strong mix |
| `M!dN1ghT$K0bRa_94`      | 100%  | Ideal complexity, hard to guess |

## Best Practices for Strong Passwords
- Use at least **12‚Äì16 characters**.
- Include **uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols**.
- Avoid **dictionary words** and **predictable patterns**.
- Use **random combinations**.
- Store passwords securely in a password manager.

## Common Password Attacks
- **Brute Force Attack** ‚Äì Attempts every possible combination.
- **Dictionary Attack** ‚Äì Uses common words and passwords.
- **Credential Stuffing** ‚Äì Uses stolen credentials across sites.
- **Phishing** ‚Äì Tricks users into revealing passwords.
- **Keylogging** ‚Äì Captures keystrokes.

## Security Summary
Password complexity directly affects resistance to attacks. Random, long, and mixed-character passwords take exponentially longer to crack compared to simple or short passwords.
